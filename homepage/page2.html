    <h2 class = "mt-3"> Greenwood </h2>
<p>You don’t know what it’s really like to experience Greenwood Cemetery until you get lost. If you come to the cemetery and only stay upon the main paths viewing the monuments and obelisks with lackadaisy you will find yourself still feeling unfulfilled. If you stay too close to home, never explore, and observe, you will find yourself unsatisfied. To truly grasp the vibrance of the cemetery one must stray from the instructed path and, like a child with crayons and a coloring book, go outside the lines. 
</p>
<p>It is obvious when someone hasn’t truly experienced the cemetery. They walk in straight lines from monument to monument, following what seems to be an agenda. These people have yet to discover their favorite elements; they are just window shopping. Eventually, they can indulge in the scenery: growing, exploring, documenting. Each becomes an architect of their own Pandora’s Box of locations, visiting and tending to them. Maybe they discover a crypt dilapidated and covered in ivy, maybe they are enthralled by the way a shadow of an oddly shaped gravestone curtsies around blades of grass, or maybe they fall in love with archways fabricated by ageless trees that keel over pathways. Conversely, one can tell if someone really knows Greenwood Cemetery. They ignore the obvious structures and beeline towards a seemingly random tree or gravestone inscribed with a semi-humorous surname. These people stay in an imminent search to once again be lost and, when they choose, be discovered. When I walk, I often go with a partner, shepherding each other in the directions of new grazing and new             exploration. The cemetery becomes a collection of memories and conversations mapped in our minds. 
</p>
<p>The cemetery and the entire city are parallel in this quality. When an individual arrives in the city, they become lost and over time come to discover themselves. By walking around exploring they begin to become more defined. I was very young when I started going to the cemetery. My parents would take me there on sunny days to escape the incessant honking and bustle to come to a place where one’s only purpose is to exist freely. As I have aged the cemetery has continued to embed itself in my identity and my history. I go there to wander and contemplate. As an adolescent, the city has brought new opportunities. I enter from the westernmost entrance where the iconic gate stands, holding the haven to the monk parrots that        inhabit the graveyard. Amidst a downpour, my childhood friend and I dig deeper into the mist. Everything feels new. The graves appear sheen and gargoyles spit droplets of water off of their stone tongues. We continue through walking paths that we h  ave seen many times before; they do not look as familiar now. 
</p>
<p>The more we walk the more I think about how little I really know about the cemetery in comparison with the immense amount of time I have spent there. I am only privy to what is above the surface: the gravestones paid for by those who had the money to pay. The further I walk the more I doubt my claim to knowing what the cemetery really is, my claim to being    a real New Yorker. Many people who go to the cemetery are extremely cautious of stepping on or disrespecting a grave, but they fail to recognize all the unmarked graves that go unnoticed. The New Yorkers who had only their identity and a subway pass to their name. My mother always said, “Yeah that and a subway token will get you a train ride.” She meant “ that” as being “smart,” being “successful,” or being “important” and was not necessary if you wanted to get on a train and explore. I now see that expression in a new light. There are so many New Yorkers who go unspoken for yet have their own stories. Every square centimeter of Greenwood has a story to tell about someone. Whether they were Basquiat, Pop Smoke, an immigrant, an American soldier, or someone whose name is not memorialized on a block of stone, they all had a story. New York is defined by its residents who go unnamed, and Greenwood is a place where one goes to become lost within the remnants of their stories, getting lost in an attempt to fabricate their meaning.
